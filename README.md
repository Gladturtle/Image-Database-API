## Image Database APi

## Description
The above API uses Flask and SQL Alchemy for a API which can store and retrive images. Using JWT for token encryption and decryption allows it to be a secure and safe image storage solution. The ability to delete users, adding images through a webpage(requests through python work as of now) and downloading images is still being implemented

## Usage
Go to [https://127.0.0.1:5000/login] and use Admin for the password and username
